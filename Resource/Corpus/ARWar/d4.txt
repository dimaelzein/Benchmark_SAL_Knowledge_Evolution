         Written by April Khan and Winnie Yu                            Overview  Symptoms  Types  Causes  Risk factors  Diagnosis  Treatment  Complications  Outlook  Prevention      Overview    When youre mountain climbing, hiking, driving, or doing any other activity at a high altitude, your body may not get enough oxygen.  The lack of oxygen can cause altitude sickness. Altitude sickness generally occurs at altitudes of 8,000 feet and above. People who arent accustomed to these heights are most vulnerable. Symptoms include headache and insomnia.  You shouldnt take altitude sickness lightly. The condition can be dangerous. Altitude sickness is impossible to predict  anyone at a high elevation can get it.    Advertisement     Advertisement    Symptoms  What are the symptoms?   The symptoms of altitude sickness can show up immediately or gradually. Symptoms of altitude sickness include:   fatigue  insomnia  headache  nausea  vomiting  rapid heart rate  shortness of breath (with or without exertion)   More serious symptoms include:   skin discoloration (a change to blue, gray, or pale)  confusion  coughing  coughing up bloody mucus  chest tightness  decreased consciousness  inability to walk in a straight line  shortness of breath at rest    Types  What are the types of altitude sickness?   Altitude sickness is classified into three groups:  AMS  Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is considered the most common form of altitude sickness. The symptoms of AMS are very similar to being intoxicated.  HACE  High-altitude cerebral edema (HACE) occurs if acute mountain sickness persists. HACE is a severe form of AMS where the brain swells and stops functioning normally. Symptoms of HACE resemble severe AMS. The most notable symptoms include:   extreme drowsiness  confusion and irritability  trouble walking   If not treated immediately, HACE can cause death.  HAPE  High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is a progression of HACE, but it can also occur on its own. Excess fluid builds up in the lungs, making it difficult for them to function normally. Symptoms of HAPE include:   increased breathlessness during exertion  severe coughing  weakness   If HAPE isnt treated promptly by decreasing altitude or using oxygen, it can lead to death.     Advertisement      Advertisement     Advertisement    Causes  What causes altitude sickness?   If your body doesnt acclimate to high elevations, you may experience altitude sickness. As altitude increases, the air becomes thinner and less oxygen-saturated. Altitude sickness is most common at elevations above 8,000 feet. Twenty percent of hikers, skiers, and adventurers traveling to high elevations between 8,000 and 18,000 feet experience altitude sickness. The number increases to 50 percent at elevations above 18,000 feet.    Risk factors  Who is at risk for altitude sickness?   Youre at low risk if youve had no previous episodes of altitude sickness. Your risk is also low if you gradually increase your altitude. Taking more than two days to climb 8,200 to 9,800 feet can help reduce your risk.  Your risk increases if you have a history of altitude sickness. Youre also at high risk if you ascend rapidly and climb more than 1,600 feet per day.

Your doctor will ask you a series of questions to look for symptoms of altitude sickness. Theyll also listen to your chest using a stethoscope if you have shortness of breath. Rattling or crackling sounds in your lungs can indicate that theres fluid in them. This requires prompt treatment. Your doctor may also do a chest X-ray to look for signs of fluid or lung collapse.     Advertisement     Treatment  How is altitude sickness treated?   Descending immediately can relieve early symptoms of altitude sickness. However, you should seek medical attention if you have advanced symptoms of acute mountain sickness.  The medication acetazolamide can reduce symptoms of altitude sickness and help improve labored breathing. You may also be given the steroid dexamethasone.  Other treatments include a lung inhaler, high blood pressure medication ( nifedipine ), and a phosphodiesterase inhibitor medication. These help reduce pressure on the arteries in your lungs. A breathing machine may provide assistance if you cant breathe on your own.    Advertisement     Advertisement    Complications  What are the complications of altitude sickness?   Complications of altitude sickness include:   pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs)  brain swelling  coma  death    Outlook  Whats the long-term outlook?   People with mild cases of altitude sickness will recover if its rapidly treated. Advanced cases of altitude sickness are harder to treat and require emergency care. People in this stage of altitude illness are at risk of coma and death due to brain swelling and the inability to breathe.     Advertisement      Advertisement     Advertisement    Prevention  Can you prevent altitude sickness?   Know the symptoms of altitude sickness before you ascend. Never go to a higher altitude to sleep if youre experiencing symptoms. Descend if symptoms get worse while youre at rest. Staying well hydrated can decrease your risk for developing altitude sickness. Also, you should minimize or avoid alcohol and caffeine, as both can contribute to dehydration.
