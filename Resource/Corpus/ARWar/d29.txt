The main result of the conflict was the American victory and the European recognition of the independence of the United States, with different results for the other powers. The war was a consequence of the American Revolution. The British Parliament insisted that it had the right to tax the colonists to finance the military defense of the colonies, which had become increasingly expensive due to the wars between the French and the Indians. The colonies were opposed to that fee by arguing that they had already spent enough on local government to maintain their position in the British Empire, with Benjamin Franklin making his presence known in the British Parliament arguing that "The colonies had already been together, dressed and paid for the past close to 25,000 men a year, and I spend many millions. " [2] The settlers claimed that, as they were British citizens, imposing laws in Parliament on settlers and, in particular, unreported taxation, was illegal. American settlers formed a unified Continental Congress and a shadow government in each colony, albeit, initially, with the desire to remain in the Empire and loyal Crowns. The American boycott of the British tea tax gave rise to a protest in 1773, when ships loaded with tea were destroyed. London responded by putting an end to Massachusetts self-government, placing it under the control of the British army, and appointing General Thomas Gage as governor. In April 1775, Gage learned that weapons were being gathered at Concord, and sent British troops to discover and destroy them. [3] The local militia opposed the troops (see Battles of Lexington and Concord). After several requests by the British monarchy for intervention by Parliament, any kind of compromise ended when the British government declared them traitors by royal decree, and they responded with a formal declaration of independence from a new non-sovereign, the United States of America, to July 4, 1776. American loyalists rejected the Declaration, siding with the king; they ended up being excluded from power everywhere. Americans' attempts to extend the rebellion to Quebec and East Florida have been unsuccessful. France, Spain and the Republic of the Netherlands have secretly provided the revolutionaries with ammunition, weapons and supplies since the beginning of 1776. In June of that year, the Americans had full control of all the decks, but the British Royal Navy captured New York making this city its main base. The war was at an impasse. The Royal Navy managed to occupy other coastal cities, for brief periods, but the rebels controlled the interior, where 90% of the population lived. The British strategy was based on the mobilization of militia loyal to the Crown, which, however, was never fully realized. An invasion from Canada in 1777 ended with the capture of the British army at the Battles of Saratoga. The American victory convinced France to enter the war, openly, in the beginning of 1778, balancing forces on both sides. Spain and the Netherlands allied with France also went into open war with the British over thand next four years, threatening to invade Britain and testing British military strength with campaigns in Europe, Asia and the Caribbean. Spanish involvement resulted in the expulsion of British armies from Florida, and control of the South American flank. The British naval victory in the Battle of Saintes thwarted a French and Spanish plan to expel the British from the Carabas, and preparations for a second attempt were blocked by the declaration of peace. The British's long Franco-Spanish siege in Gibraltar also resulted in defeat. French involvement was decisive [4] however the cost was high, in financial terms, ruining the French economy and giving rise to enormous debt. [5] A naval victory outside Chesapeake Bay gave rise to a siege, composed of combined French forces and Continental armies, which forced a British army to surrender in Yorktown, Virginia, in 1781. The struggle continued during 1782, while peace negotiations were beginning. In 1783, the Treaty of Paris put an end to the war and recognized the sovereignty of the United States of America in the territory between Canada, in the north, Florida, in the south, and the Mississippi River in the west. [6] [7] In wider peace negotiations, internationally, more territories were exchanged.

At the end of the Seven Years' War in 1763 (and the Franco-Indian War), the United Kingdom of Great Britain emerged triumphant against France in North America, but ended up heavily in debt. Taxes in Britain were already very high, so it was decided that American settlers should contribute more. The British Parliament then passed the March 1965 seal law, which placed a direct tax on the colonies that formally began on 1 November. The new tax angered American settlers, who argued that their "rights as Englishmen" meant that new taxes could not be levied on them as they had no representation in Parliament. [8] At that time, in fact, many settlers rejected the representativeness solution by claiming that their "local circumstances" made this impossible. [9] [10] Civil resistance prevented the stamp law from being implemented and boycotts of British products took effect. This resistance was unexpected and generated "violent and natural irritation" among the British. [11] A change of government in Britain ended up repelling the stamp law, but the new parliament passed the Declaratory Law of 1766, which said that "the colonies and plantations in America were, will only be subordinate and dependent on the Crown. Imperial and the UK Parliament ". [12] The Americans declared that domestic laws imposed on them, such as the stamp law, were illegal, but not external ones such as customs fees. In 1767, the English Parliament passed a law creating so-called Townshend Tariffs, which imposed taxes on various British goods exported to the colonies. The Americans denounced this as illegal as well, since the purpose of these tariffs was to increase the state's income and not to regulate trade. [11] In 1768, violence began to take hold of Boston, the city with the largest ports in the New England region. One of the reasons for the complaints was the anti-smuggling actions taken by the British government and the sending of 4,000 British soldiers to occupy the city. Parliament in London threatened to enact Massachusetts citizens as traitors. American settlers were not intimidated and formed associations to boycott British goods, although less efficient than before as Townshend fares were widely used. In March 1770, five settlers in Boston were killed when English soldiers opened fire on a crowd protesting in front of the royal governor's home. This news spread outrage across the Thirteen Colonies. In 1770, Parliament tried to placate the Americans by repelling all taxes except those on tea. [13] In 1773, in an effort to financially rescue the British Company from the East Indies, the British tried to increase sales of tea by reducing its price and appointed certain merchants in America to receive this product and sell it. All the colonies resisted this, and when the Governor of Massachusetts refused to send back the tea ships anchored in Boston, American settlers destroyed several boxes of tea that were on these vessels. [14] Crisis [edit | edit source code] 1846 lithography by Nathaniel Currier called The Destruction of Tea at Boston Harbor "; the term" Boston Tea Party "(" Boston Tea Party ") was not yet used to describe the event. the way Currier presented it, there were very few men dressed up as Indians that day.
