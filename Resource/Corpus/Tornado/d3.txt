Introduction
Tornadoes are nature's most violent storms. They are rotating funnel-shaped clouds that extend from a thunderstorm to the surface. Its spiral winds can reach 300 miles per hour. They can strike quickly, with little or no warning, devastate a neighborhood in seconds and leave a trail of damage a mile in diameter and 50 miles long. Tornadoes can also accompany tropical storms and hurricanes as they cross onto land.
