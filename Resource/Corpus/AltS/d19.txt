1. Descend to Lower Altitude
For mild acute mountain sickness, the person may be able to stay at current altitude to see if his or her body adjusts. If symptoms donâ€™t get better in 24 to 48 hours or if they get worse, the person should go down to a lower altitude and seek immediate medical care.
For severe symptoms, the person should immediately be taken down 1,500 to 2,000 feet with as little exertion as possible. Keep going down until symptoms go away. Get medical help right away as waiting could cause serious problems or even death.
Even if symptoms are mild, the person should not go any higher in altitude until symptoms are completely gone.
2. Treat Symptoms
Give oxygen, if available.
Keep the person warm and have him or her rest.
Give plenty of liquids.
Give acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) for headache.
3. See a Health Care Provider
If mild symptoms persist after descent, call a health care provider.
For severe symptoms, the person should see a doctor as soon as possible, even if symptoms go away after descent.
