This timeline of the evolutionary history of life represents the current scientific theory outlining the major events during the development of life on planet Earth. In biology, evolution is any change across successive generations in the heritable characteristics of biological populations. Evolutionary processes give rise to diversity at every level of biological organization, from kingdoms to species, and individual organisms and molecules, such as DNA and proteins. The similarities between all present day organisms indicate the presence of a common ancestor from which all known species, living and extinct, have diverged through the process of evolution. More than 99 percent of all species, amounting to over five billion species,[1] that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct.[2][3] Estimates on the number of Earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million,[4] of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet been described.[5]

While the dates given in this article are estimates based on scientific evidence, there has been controversy between more traditional views of increased biodiversity through a cone of diversity with the passing of time and the view that the basic pattern on Earth has been one of annihilation and diversification and that in certain past times, such as the Cambrian explosion, there was great diversity.[6][7]

Extinction
Main article: Extinction event

Visual representation of the history of life on Earth as a spiral.
Species go extinct constantly as environments change, organisms compete for environmental niches, and genetic mutation leads to the rise of new species from older ones. Occasionally biodiversity on the planet takes a hit in the form of a mass extinction in which the extinction rate is much higher than usual.[8] A large extinction event often represents an accumulation of smaller extinction events that take place in a relatively brief period of time.[9]

The first known mass extinction in earth's history was the Great Oxygenation Event 2.4 billion years ago. The event led to the loss of most of the planet's obligate anaerobes. The five largest extinction events in earth's history since are these:[10]

End of the Ordovician: 440 million years ago, 86% of all species lost, including graptolites
Late Devonian: 375 million years ago, 75% of species lost, including trilobites
End of the Permian, "The Great Dying": 251 million years ago, 96% of species lost, including tabulate corals, and most extant trees and synapsids
End of the Triassic: 200 million years ago, 80% of species lost, including all of the conodonts
End of the Cretaceous: 66 million years ago, 76% of species lost, including all of the ammonites, mosasaurs, ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, and nonavian dinosaurs
(Dates and percentages represent estimates.)

Smaller extinction events have occurred in the periods between these larger catastrophes, with some standing at the delineation points of the periods and epochs recognized by scientists in geologic time. The Holocene extinction event is currently under way.[11]

Factors in mass extinctions include continental drift, changes in atmospheric and marine chemistry, volcanism and other aspects of mountain formation, changes in glaciation, changes in sea level, and impact events.[9]

Hadean Eon

Moon
Main article: Hadean
4000 Ma and earlier.

Date	Event
4600 Ma	The planet Earth forms from the accretion disc revolving around the young Sun with organic compounds (complex organic molecules) necessary for life having perhaps formed in the protoplanetary disk of cosmic dust grains surrounding it before the formation of the Earth.[12]
4500 Ma	According to the giant impact hypothesis, the Moon was formed when the planet Earth and the hypothesized planet Theia collided, sending a very large number of moonlets into orbit around the young Earth which eventually coalesce to form the Moon.[13] The gravitational pull of the new Moon stabilised the Earth's fluctuating axis of rotation and set up the conditions in which abiogenesis occurred.[14]
4404 Ma	First appearance of liquid water on Earth.
4280 Ma	Earliest appearance of life on Earth.[15][16][17][18]
Archean Eon

4000 Ma – 2500 Ma

Date	Event
4000 Ma	Formation of a greenstone belt of the Acasta Gneiss of the Slave craton in Northwest Territories, Canada, the oldest rock belt in the world.[19]
4100–3800 Ma	Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB): extended barrage of impact events upon the inner planets by meteoroids. Thermal flux from widespread hydrothermal activity during the LHB may have been conducive to abiogenesis and life's early diversification.[20] "Remains of biotic life" were found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.[21][22] According to one of the researchers, "If life arose relatively quickly on Earth ... then it could be common in the universe."[21]
3900–2500 Ma	Cells resembling prokaryotes appear.[23] These first organisms are chemoautotrophs: they use carbon dioxide as a carbon source and oxidize inorganic materials to extract energy. Later, prokaryotes evolve glycolysis, a set of chemical reactions that free the energy of organic molecules such as glucose and store it in the chemical bonds of ATP. Glycolysis (and ATP) continue to be used in almost all organisms, unchanged, to this day.[24][25]
3800 Ma	Formation of a greenstone belt of the Isua complex of the western Greenland region, whose rocks show an isotope frequency suggestive of the presence of life.[19] The earliest evidences for life on Earth are 3.8 billion-year-old biogenic hematite in a banded iron formation of the Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt in Canada,[26] graphite in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in western Greenland[27] and microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia.[28][29]
3500 Ma	Lifetime of the last universal common ancestor (LUCA);[30][31] the split between bacteria and archaea occurs.[32]
Bacteria develop primitive forms of photosynthesis which at first did not produce oxygen.[33] These organisms generated Adenosine triphosphate by exploiting a proton gradient, a mechanism still used in virtually all organisms.[34]

3000 Ma	Photosynthesizing cyanobacteria evolved; they used water as a reducing agent, thereby producing oxygen as a waste product.[35] The oxygen initially oxidizes dissolved iron in the oceans, creating iron ore. The oxygen concentration in the atmosphere slowly rose, acting as a poison for many bacteria and eventually triggering the Great Oxygenation Event. The Moon, still very close to Earth, caused tides 1,000 feet (305 m) high.[citation needed] The Earth was continually wracked by hurricane-force winds. These extreme mixing influences are thought to have stimulated evolutionary processes.[citation needed]. Life on land likely developed at this time.[36]

Main article: Proterozoic
2500 Ma – 542 Ma. Contains the Palaeoproterozoic, Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic eras.

Date	Event
2500 Ma	Great Oxygenation Event led by cyanobacteria's oxygenic photosynthesis.[35] Commencement of plate tectonics with old marine crust dense enough to subduct.[19]
2000 Ma	Diversification and expansion of acritarchs.[37]
By 1850 Ma	Eukaryotic cells appear. Eukaryotes contain membrane-bound organelles with diverse functions, probably derived from prokaryotes engulfing each other via phagocytosis. (See Symbiogenesis and Endosymbiont). Bacterial viruses (bacteriophage) emerge before, or soon after, the divergence of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic lineages.[38] The appearance of red beds show that an oxidising atmosphere had been produced. Incentives now favoured the spread of eukaryotic life.[39][40][41]
1400 Ma	Great increase in stromatolite diversity.
By 1200 Ma	Meiosis and sexual reproduction are present in single-celled eukaryotes, and possibly in the common ancestor of all eukaryotes.[42] Sex may even have arisen earlier in the RNA world.[43] Sexual reproduction first appears in the fossil records; it may have increased the rate of evolution.[44]
800 Ma	First multicellular organism may have arisen.[45]
750 Ma	First protozoa (ex: Melanocyrillium)
850–630 Ma	A global glaciation may have occurred.[46][47] Opinion is divided on whether it increased or decreased biodiversity or the rate of evolution.[48][49][50]
600 Ma	The accumulation of atmospheric oxygen allows the formation of an ozone layer.[51] Prior to this, land-based life would probably have required other chemicals to attenuate ultraviolet radiation enough to permit colonisation of the land.[36]
580–542 Ma	The Ediacara biota represent the first large, complex multicellular organisms — although their affinities remain a subject of debate.[52]
580–500 Ma	Most modern phyla of animals begin to appear in the fossil record during the Cambrian explosion.[53][54]
560 Ma	Earliest fungi
550 Ma	First fossil evidence for Ctenophora (comb jellies), Porifera (sponges), Anthozoa (corals and sea anemones)
Phanerozoic Eon
Main article: Phanerozoic
542 Ma – present

The Phanerozoic Eon, literally the "period of well-displayed life," marks the appearance in the fossil record of abundant, shell-forming and/or trace-making organisms. It is subdivided into three eras, the Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic, which are divided by major mass extinctions.

Palaeozoic Era
Main article: Paleozoic
542 Ma – 251.0 Ma and contains the Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous and Permian periods.

Date	Event
535 Ma	Major diversification of living things in the oceans: chordates, arthropods (e.g. trilobites, crustaceans), echinoderms, molluscs, brachiopods, foraminifers and radiolarians, etc.
530 Ma	The first known footprints on land date to 530 Ma, indicating that early animal explorations may have predated the development of terrestrial plants.[55]
525 Ma	Earliest graptolites
510 Ma	First cephalopods (nautiloids) and chitons
505 Ma	Fossilization of the Burgess Shale
485 Ma	First vertebrates with true bones (jawless fishes)
450 Ma	First complete conodonts and echinoids appear
440 Ma	First agnathan fishes: Heterostraci, Galeaspida, and Pituriaspida
434 Ma	The first primitive plants move onto land,[56] having evolved from green algae living along the edges of lakes.[57] They are accompanied by fungi[citation needed], which may have aided the colonization of land through symbiosis.
420 Ma	Earliest ray-finned fishes, trigonotarbid arachnids, and land scorpions[58]
410 Ma	First signs of teeth in fish. Earliest Nautilida, lycophytes, and trimerophytes.
395 Ma	First lichens, stoneworts. Earliest harvestmen, mites, hexapods (springtails) and ammonoids. The first known tetrapod tracks on land.
363 Ma	By the start of the Carboniferous Period, the Earth begins to resemble its present state. Insects roamed the land and would soon take to the skies; sharks swam the oceans as top predators,[59] and vegetation covered the land, with seed-bearing plants and forests soon to flourish.
Four-limbed tetrapods gradually gain adaptations which will help them occupy a terrestrial life-habit.

360 Ma	First crabs and ferns. Land flora dominated by seed ferns.
350 Ma	First large sharks, ratfishes, and hagfish
340 Ma	Diversification of amphibians
330 Ma	First amniote vertebrates (Paleothyris)
320 Ma	Synapsids (precursors to mammals) separate from sauropsids (reptiles) in late Carboniferous.[60]
305 Ma	Earliest diapsid reptiles (e.g. Petrolacosaurus)
280 Ma	Earliest beetles, seed plants and conifers diversify while lepidodendrids and sphenopsids decrease. Terrestrial temnospondyl amphibians and pelycosaurs (e.g. Dimetrodon) diversify in species.
275 Ma	Therapsid synapsids separate from pelycosaur synapsids
251.4 Ma	The Permian–Triassic extinction event eliminates over 90-95% of marine species. Terrestrial organisms were not as seriously affected as the marine biota. This "clearing of the slate" may have led to an ensuing diversification, but life on land took 30 million years to completely recover.[61]
Mesozoic Era
Main article: Mesozoic

Utatsusaurus is the earliest-known form of an ichthyopterygian.

Plateosaurus engelhardti

Cycas circinalis
From 251.4 Ma to 66 Ma and containing the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.

Date	Event
The Mesozoic Marine Revolution begins: increasingly well adapted and diverse predators[who?] pressurize sessile marine groups; the "balance of power" in the oceans shifts dramatically as some groups of prey[who?] adapt more rapidly and effectively than others[who?].
248 Ma	Sturgeon and paddlefish (Acipenseridae) first appear.
245 Ma	Earliest ichthyosaurs
240 Ma	Increase in diversity of gomphodont cynodonts and rhynchosaurs
225 Ma	Earliest dinosaurs (prosauropods), first cardiid bivalves, diversity in cycads, bennettitaleans, and conifers. First teleost fishes. First mammals (Adelobasileus).
220 Ma	Seed-producing Gymnosperm forests dominate the land; herbivores grow to huge sizes to accommodate the large guts necessary to digest the nutrient-poor plants.[citation needed] First flies and turtles (Odontochelys). First coelophysoid dinosaurs.
205
Ma

the Massive extinction of Triassic/Jurassic, that wiped out most of the group of pseudosuchians and was given the opportunity of dinosaurs including the Apatosaurus, Tyrannosaurus, Perrotasaurus, and Stegosaurus to enter its golden age.
200 Ma	The first accepted evidence for viruses that infect eukaryotic cells (at least, the group Geminiviridae) existed.[62] Viruses are still poorly understood and may have arisen before "life" itself, or may be a more recent phenomenon.
Major extinctions in terrestrial vertebrates and large amphibians. Earliest examples of armoured dinosaurs

195 Ma	First pterosaurs with specialized feeding (Dorygnathus). First sauropod dinosaurs. Diversification in small, ornithischian dinosaurs: heterodontosaurids, fabrosaurids, and scelidosaurids.
190 Ma	Pliosauroids appear in the fossil record. First lepidopteran insects (Archaeolepis), hermit crabs, modern starfish, irregular echinoids, corbulid bivalves, and tubulipore bryozoans. Extensive development of sponge reefs.
176 Ma	First members of the Stegosauria group of dinosaurs
170 Ma	Earliest salamanders, newts, cryptoclidids, elasmosaurid plesiosaurs, and cladotherian mammals. Sauropod dinosaurs diversify.
165 Ma	First rays and glycymeridid bivalves
163 Ma	Pterodactyloid pterosaurs first appear[63]
161 Ma	Ceratopsian dinosaurs appear in the fossil record (Yinlong) and the oldest known Eutherian Mammal appear in the fossil record: Juramaia.
160 Ma	Multituberculate mammals (genus Rugosodon) appear in eastern China
155 Ma	First blood-sucking insects (ceratopogonids), rudist bivalves, and cheilostome bryozoans. Archaeopteryx, a possible ancestor to the birds, appears in the fossil record, along with triconodontid and symmetrodont mammals. Diversity in stegosaurian and theropod dinosaurs.
130 Ma	The rise of the angiosperms: Some of these flowering plants bear structures that attract insects and other animals to spread pollen;other angiosperms were pollinated by wind or water. This innovation causes a major burst of animal evolution through coevolution. First freshwater pelomedusid turtles.
120 Ma	Oldest fossils of heterokonts, including both marine diatoms and silicoflagellates
115 Ma	First monotreme mammals
110 Ma	First hesperornithes, toothed diving birds. Earliest limopsid, verticordiid, and thyasirid bivalves.
106 Ma	Spinosaurus, the largest theropod dinosaur, appears in the fossil record
100 Ma	Earliest bees
90 Ma	Extinction of ichthyosaurs. Earliest snakes and nuculanid bivalves. Large diversification in angiosperms: magnoliids, rosids, hamamelidids, monocots, and ginger. Earliest examples of ticks. Probable origins of placental mammals (earliest undisputed fossil evidence is 66 Ma).
80 Ma	First ants
70 Ma	Multituberculate mammals increase in diversity. First yoldiid bivalves.
68 Ma	Tyrannosaurus, the largest terrestrial predator of what is now western North America appears in the fossil record. First species of Triceratops.
