Theory of Evolution Proven?
There is no demonstrable evidence for the big bang, and chemical evolution has failed to create living systems in the laboratory. In spite of billions of fossils being found, there are no unquestionable fossils that show a transition between any of the major life-forms.

The Basic Assumptions of Evolution
Sir Arthur Keith summarizes the evolution doctrine as follows: “Evolution is unproven and unprovable. We believe it, however, because the only alternative is an act of creation by a God, and that is unthinkable.”

Evolution and Science
Some evolutionists have argued that science isn’t possible without evolution. They teach that science and technology actually require the principles of molecules-to-man evolution in order to work. Actually, evolution is anti-science and anti-knowledge.

The National Center for Science Education
The NCSE praises Bill Nye’s stand on the necessity of accepting evolution in order to make technological and economic progress and even to be scientifically literate. However, evolutionary dogma does not contribute to the “here-and-now” science used to probe the secrets of the present and to develop new technologies.
