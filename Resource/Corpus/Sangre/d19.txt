THE SANGRE DE CRISTO MOUNTAINS! Mountain Scenery In the San Luis Valley February 21, 2006      Click any image to view it at a larger size.     Here's a picture collection of the Sangre De Cristo Mountains
 from various vantage points in the San Luis Valley. We were on our way to the Great Sand Dunes National Park , and let's just say
 the stunning Colorado mountain scenery speaks for itself. (Adjacent photo: The Northern Sangre De Cristo Range to the east of the town of Villa Grove)         East of the small town of Hooper, the towering Sangre De Cristo
 range stands tall. In the bottom photo, I did not crop the picture at all to hopefully give you
 some perspective on just how commonly isolated and desert-like the floor of the San Luis Valley is in this spot.         Where the desert and mountains meet! I stood in the same spot for both of these photos, with me zooming-in on the bottom photo.       The sand dunes in the foreground.

I adjusted the picture to 
black & white, which I like much better. ;) My pages of the Sangre De Cristo Range
