The Crestones are a group of four mountains over 4,268 meters (14,000 feet) high, located in the Sangre de Cristo mountain range near the town of the same name, Crestone, Colorado. Crestons include[1]:

Creston Peak - 4359 m. (the highest mountain of both the Crestons and the entire Creston group)
Creston Needle[en] - 4327 m.
Kit Carson[en] - 4317 m. (plus 2 - 4 non-independent mountain peaks)
Peak Humboldt[en] - 4287 m.
Broken Hand Peak, southeast of the Creston Needle[en], is also part of the Crestons[1], but its height is just below 14,000 feet, 4,137 meters. Mount Adams, 4246 meters, is a notable mountain north of the Crestons, but is not part of them.

Climbing
Snow usually melts in early July. At the end of July and August, the climber can expect rain, hail and lightning from the seasonal monsoon.

Creston Peak and Creston Needle[en] are rated Class 3 Yosemite Decimal[en] with some exposure to altitude. Creston Peak has a significant rockfall hazard.

Kit Carson[en] is trekking (Yosamite Decimal Class 2[en]), but only if the route is followed exactly. More people died on this mountain than on the higher Creston Peak and Creston Needle[en]. Challenger Point (4294 m) and Columbia Point (4255 m) are sub-peaks of Mount Kit Carson[en]. Two more sub-peaks, Kitty Kat Carson and The Prow, according to different sources, are either Kit Carson's sub-peaks[en], or independent peaks.

Humboldt Peak is the easiest of the four peaks and there is a regular trekking route to this peak. Sometimes Humboldt is not included in the Crestons, an alternative to this group of mountains is the Tritetons (eng. The Three Tetons) [1].

Please note that Creston Peak and Creston Needle[en] are somewhat more technical peaks than many of Colorado's four-thousanders, caution is advised when climbing. On average, one person per year dies on the Cretons, sometimes they are experienced climbers [2].
