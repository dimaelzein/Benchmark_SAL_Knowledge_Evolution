Flyby missions include: Mariner 3-4 | Mariner 6-7             Orbiters :       As our knowledge and technologies grew, we began putting spacecraft in orbit around Mars for longer term, global studies. Orbital missions include: Mariner 8-9 | Viking 1-2 | Mars Observer | Mars Global Surveyor | Mars Climate Orbiter | 2001 Mars Odyssey | Mars Express | Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter | Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution | NASA In ESA's ExoMars Orbiter             Landers & Rovers :       Then, with even more capabilities over the years, we began to land on the surface. Today, we're not only landing in one place, but have shown that we can be mobile on the surface of Mars. Landed missions include: Viking 1-2 | Pathfinder | Polar Lander/Deep Space 2 | Mars Exploration Rovers | Phoenix | Mars Science Laboratory | InSight | NASA In ESA's ExoMars Rover | 2020 Mission Plans        In the future, Mars exploration may bring:      Airplanes & Balloons :       We may send craft that can study the planet from a perspective we've never achieved before: soaring views from the Martian sky.             Subsurface Explorers :       Going below the ground will tell us more about the geology of the planet, the presence of water, and maybe even clues about whether Mars was ever a habitat for life.             Sample Returns :       Bringing samples of Martian rocks, soils, and atmosphere back to Earth would give us the opportunity to study the red planet close-up, in laboratories here on Earth.
