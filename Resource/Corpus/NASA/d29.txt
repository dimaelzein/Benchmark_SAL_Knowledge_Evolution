Roughly two-thirds of all spacecraft destined for Mars failed before completing their missions and some failed before their observations could begin. Some missions have met with unexpected success, such as the twin Mars Exploration Rovers , which operated for years beyond their specification. [2] On 24 October 2016, two scientific rovers were on the surface of Mars beaming signals back to Earth ( Opportunity of the Mars Exploration Rover mission and Curiosity of the Mars Science Laboratory mission), with six orbiters surveying the planet: Mars Odyssey , Mars Express , Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter , Mars Orbiter Mission , MAVEN , and the Trace Gas Orbiter , which have contributed massive amounts of information about Mars. No sample return missions have been attempted for Mars and an attempted return mission for Mars' moon  Phobos ( Fobos-Grunt ) failed. [3]  On 24 January 2014, NASA reported that current studies on the planet Mars by the Curiosity and Opportunity  rovers will search for evidence of ancient life, including a biosphere based on autotrophic , chemotrophic and/or chemolithoautotrophic  microorganisms , as well as ancient water, including fluvio-lacustrine environments ( plains related to ancient rivers or lakes ) that may have been habitable . [1] [4] [5] [6] The search for evidence of habitability , taphonomy (related to fossils ), and organic carbon on the planet Mars is now a primary NASA objective. [1]    Play media   The landing site of each Mars mission can be seen on this rotating globe.     Martian system [ edit ]  Main articles: Mars , Martian surface , Atmosphere of Mars , and Moons of Mars  Mars has long been the subject of human interest. Early telescopic observations revealed color changes on the surface that were attributed to seasonal vegetation and apparent linear features were ascribed to intelligent design. Further telescopic observations found two moons, Phobos and Deimos , polar ice caps and the feature now known as Olympus Mons , the solar system's tallest mountain. The discoveries piqued further interest in the study and exploration of the red planet. Mars is a rocky planet, like Earth, that formed around the same time, yet with only half the diameter of Earth, and a far thinner atmosphere, it has a cold and desert-like surface.

[9] In addition, the lowest available transfer energy varies on a roughly 16-year cycle. [9] For example, a minimum occurred in the 1969 and 1971 launch windows, rising to a peak in the late 1970s, and hitting another low in 1986 and 1988.

North polar view by Phoenix lander, 2008.     Starting in 1960, the Soviets launched a series of probes to Mars including the first intended flybys and hard ( impact ) landing ( Mars 1962B ). [10] The first successful fly-by of Mars was on 1415 July 1965, by NASA's Mariner 4 . [11] On November 14, 1971 Mariner 9 became the first space probe to orbit another planet when it entered into orbit around Mars. [12] The amount of data returned by probes increased dramatically as technology improved. [10]  The first to contact the surface were two Soviet probes: Mars 2 lander on November 27 and Mars 3 lander on December 2, 1971Mars 2 failed during descent and Mars 3 about twenty seconds after the first Martian soft landing . [13]  Mars 6 failed during descent but did return some corrupted atmospheric data in 1974. [14] The 1975 NASA launches of the Viking program consisted of two orbiters, each with a lander that successfully soft landed in 1976. Viking 1 remained operational for six years, Viking 2 for three. The Viking landers relayed the first color panoramas of Mars. [15]  The Soviet probes Phobos 1 and 2 were sent to Mars in 1988 to study Mars and its two moons, with a focus on Phobos. Phobos 1 lost contact on the way to Mars. Phobos 2, while successfully photographing Mars and Phobos, failed before it was set to release two landers to the surface of Phobos. [16]  Roughly two-thirds of all spacecraft destined for Mars have failed without completing their missions, and it has a reputation as a difficult space exploration target. [17]  Missions that ended prematurely after Phobos 1 & 2 (1988) include (see Probing difficulties section for more details):   Mars Observer (launched in 1992)  Mars 96 (1996)  Mars Climate Orbiter (1999)  Mars Polar Lander with Deep Space 2 (1999)  Nozomi (2003)  Beagle 2 (2003)  Fobos-Grunt with Yinghuo-1 (2011)  Schiaparelli lander (2016)   Following the 1993 failure of the Mars Observer orbiter, the NASA Mars Global Surveyor achieved Mars orbit in 1997. This mission was a complete success, having finished its primary mapping mission in early 2001. Contact was lost with the probe in November 2006 during its third extended program, spending exactly 10 operational years in space. The NASA Mars Pathfinder , carrying a robotic exploration vehicle Sojourner , landed in the Ares Vallis on Mars in the summer of 1997, returning many images. [18]  Phoenix landed on the north polar region of Mars on May 25, 2008. [19] Its robotic arm dug into the Martian soil and the presence of water ice was confirmed on June 20, 2008. [20] [21] The mission concluded on November 10, 2008 after contact was lost. [22] In 2008, the price of transporting material from the surface of Earth to the surface of Mars was approximately US$ 309,000 per kilogram . [23]  Rosetta came within 250km of Mars during its 2007 flyby. [24]  Dawn flew by Mars in February 2009 for a gravity assist on its way to investigate Vesta and Ceres .

The Electra radio of the MAVEN orbiter    NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter entered Mars orbit in 2001. [26] Odyssey's Gamma Ray Spectrometer detected significant amounts of hydrogen in the upper metre or so of regolith on Mars. This hydrogen is thought to be contained in large deposits of water ice. [27]  The Mars Express mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) reached Mars in 2003. It carried the Beagle 2 lander, which was not heard from after being released and was declared lost in February 2004. Beagle 2 was located in January 2015 by HiRise camera on NASAs Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) having landed safely but failed to fully deploy its solar panels and antenna. [28] [29] In early 2004 the Mars Express Planetary Fourier Spectrometer team announced the orbiter had detected methane in the Martian atmosphere. ESA announced in June 2006 the discovery of aurorae on Mars. [30]  In January 2004, the NASA twin Mars Exploration Rovers named Spirit (MER-A) and Opportunity (MER-B) landed on the surface of Mars. Both have met or exceeded all their targets. Among the most significant scientific returns has been conclusive evidence that liquid water existed at some time in the past at both landing sites. Martian dust devils and windstorms have occasionally cleaned both rovers' solar panels, and thus increased their lifespan. [31]  Spirit Rover (MER-A) was active until 2010, when it stopped sending data because it had fallen into a sand dune. [3]  On 10 March 2006, the NASA Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) probe arrived in orbit to conduct a two-year science survey. The orbiter began mapping the Martian terrain and weather to find suitable landing sites for upcoming lander missions. The MRO snapped the first image of a series of active avalanches near the planet's north pole , scientists said March 3, 2008. [32]  The Mars Science Laboratory mission was launched on November 26, 2011 and it delivered the Curiosity rover , on the surface of Mars on August 6, 2012 UTC . It is larger and more advanced than the Mars Exploration Rovers, with a velocity of up to 90 meters per hour (295 feet per hour). [33] Experiments include a laser chemical sampler that can deduce the make-up of rocks at a distance of 7 meters. [34] The next US mission to arrive would be MAVEN  The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) launched its Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) on November 5, 2013. It was successfully inserted into Mars orbit on 24 September 2014. India's ISRO is the fourth space agency to reach Mars, after the Soviet space program , NASA and ESA . [35] India became the first country to successfully get a spacecraft into Mars orbit on its maiden attempt. [36]  The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter arrived at Mars in 2016 and deployed the Schiaparelli EDM lander , a test lander that had Partial success. Crash-landed on surface, but transmitted data during descent. [37]  Overview of missions [ edit ]  The following entails a brief overview of Mars exploration, oriented towards orbiters and flybys; see also Mars landing and Mars rover .  Early Soviet missions [ edit ]  Main articles: Mars 1M , Mars 1 , and Mars program      Mars 1M spacecraft.    1960s [ edit ]  Between 1960 and 1969, the Soviet Union launched nine probes intended to reach Mars. They all failed: three at launch; three failed to reach near-Earth orbit; one during the burn to put the spacecraft into trans-Mars trajectory; and two during the interplanetary orbit.  The Mars 1M programs (sometimes dubbed Marsnik in Western media) was the first Soviet unmanned spacecraft interplanetary exploration program, which consisted of two flyby probes launched towards Mars in October 1960, Mars 1960A and Mars 1960B (also known as Korabl 4 and Korabl 5 respectively). After launch, the third stage pumps on both launchers were unable to develop enough pressure to commence ignition, so Earth parking orbit was not achieved. The spacecraft reached an altitude of 120km before reentry.  Mars 1962A was a Mars fly-by mission, launched on October 24, 1962 and Mars 1962B a intended first Mars lander mission, launched in late December of the same year (1962). Both failed from either breaking up as they were going into Earth orbit or having the upper stage explode in orbit during the burn to put the spacecraft into trans-Mars trajectory.

Mars 1 was intended to fly by the planet at a distance of about 11,000km and take images of the surface as well as send back data on cosmic radiation , micrometeoroid impacts and Mars' magnetic field , radiation environment, atmospheric structure, and possible organic compounds. [38] [39] Sixty-one radio transmissions were held, initially at two-day intervals and later at 5 day intervals, from which a large amount of interplanetary data was collected. On 21 March 1963, when the spacecraft was at a distance of 106,760,000km from Earth, on its way to Mars, communications ceased due to failure of its antenna orientation system. [38] [39]  In 1964, both Soviet probe launches, of Zond 1964A on June 4, and Zond 2 on November 30, (part of the Zond program ), resulted in failures. Zond 1964A had a failure at launch, while communication was lost with Zond 2 en route to Mars after a mid-course maneuver, in early May 1965. [3]  In 1969, and as part of the Mars probe program , the Soviet Union prepared two identical 5-ton orbiters called M-69, dubbed by NASA as Mars 1969A and Mars 1969B . Both probes were lost in launch-related complications with the newly developed Proton rocket. [40]  1970s [ edit ]  The USSR intended to have the first artificial satellite of Mars beating the planned American Mariner 8 and Mariner 9 Mars orbiters. In May 1971, one day after Mariner 8 malfunctioned at launch and failed to reach orbit, Cosmos 419 (Mars 1971C) , a heavy probe of the Soviet Mars program M-71, also failed to launch. This spacecraft was designed as an orbiter only, while the next two probes of project M-71, Mars 2 and Mars 3 , were multipurpose combinations of an orbiter and a lander with small skis-walking rovers that would be the first planet rovers outside the Moon. They were successfully launched in mid-May 1971 and reached Mars about seven months later. On November 27, 1971 the lander of Mars 2 crash-landed due to an on-board computer malfunction and became the first man-made object to reach the surface of Mars. On 2 December 1971, the Mars 3 lander became the first spacecraft to achieve a soft landing , but its transmission was interrupted after 14.5 seconds. [41]  The Mars 2 and 3 orbiters sent back a relatively large volume of data covering the period from December 1971 to March 1972, although transmissions continued through to August. By 22 August 1972, after sending back data and a total of 60 pictures, Mars 2 and 3 concluded their missions. The images and data enabled creation of surface relief maps, and gave information on the Martian gravity and magnetic fields . [42]  In 1973, the Soviet Union sent four more probes to Mars: the Mars 4 and Mars 5 orbiters and the Mars 6 and Mars 7 fly-by/lander combinations. All missions except Mars 7 sent back data, with Mars 5 being most successful. That is not to say much about the fourth missions, Mars 5 died less than three weeks after entering orbit. Mars 5 transmitted just 60 images before a loss of pressurization in the transmitter housing ended the mission. Mars 6 lander transmitted data during descent, but failed upon impact. Mars 4 flew by the planet at a range of 2200km returning one swath of pictures and radio occultation data, which constituted the first detection of the nightside ionosphere on Mars. [43] Mars 7 probe separated prematurely from the carrying vehicle due to a problem in the operation of one of the onboard systems ( attitude control or retro-rockets) and missed the planet by 1,300 kilometres (8.7  10 6 au). [ citation needed ]  Mariner program [ edit ]  Main articles: Mariner program , Mariner 4 , Mariner 6 and 7 , and Mariner 9     The first close-up images taken of Mars in 1965 from Mariner 4 show an area about 330 km across by 1200 km from limb to bottom of frame.    In 1964, NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory made two attempts at reaching Mars. Mariner 3 and Mariner 4 were identical spacecraft designed to carry out the first flybys of Mars. Mariner 3 was launched on November 5, 1964, but the shroud encasing the spacecraft atop its rocket failed to open properly, dooming the mission. Three weeks later, on November 28, 1964, Mariner 4 was launched successfully on a 7-month voyage to Mars.. [ citation needed ]  Mariner 4 flew past Mars on July 14, 1965, providing the first close-up photographs of another planet. The pictures, gradually played back to Earth from a small tape recorder on the probe, showed impact craters. It provided radically more accurate data about the planet; a surface atmospheric pressure of about 1% of Earth's and daytime temperatures of 100C (148F) were estimated. No magnetic field [44] [45] or Martian radiation belts [46] were detected. The new data meant redesigns for then planned Martian landers, and showed life would have a more difficult time surviving there than previously anticipated. [47] [48] [49] [50]      Mariner Crater , as seen by Mariner 4. The location is Phaethontis quadrangle .    NASA continued the Mariner program with another pair of Mars flyby probes, Mariner 6 and 7 . They were sent at the next launch window, and reached the planet in 1969. During the following launch window the Mariner program again suffered the loss of one of a pair of probes. Mariner 9 successfully entered orbit about Mars, the first spacecraft ever to do so, after the launch time failure of its sister ship, Mariner 8 . When Mariner 9 reached Mars in 1971, it and two Soviet orbiters ( Mars 2 and Mars 3 , see Mars probe program below) found that a planet-wide dust storm was in progress. The mission controllers used the time spent waiting for the storm to clear to have the probe rendezvous with, and photograph, Phobos . When the storm cleared sufficiently for Mars' surface to be photographed by Mariner 9, the pictures returned represented a substantial advance over previous missions. These pictures were the first to offer more detailed evidence that liquid water might at one time have flowed on the planetary surface. They also finally discerned the true nature of many Martian albedo features. For example, Nix Olympica was one of only a few features that could be seen during the planetary duststorm, revealing it to be the highest mountain ( volcano , to be exact) on any planet in the entire Solar System , and leading to its reclassification as Olympus Mons .

The primary scientific objectives of the lander mission were to search for biosignatures and observe meteorologic , seismic and magnetic properties of Mars. The results of the biological experiments on board the Viking landers remain inconclusive, with a reanalysis of the Viking data published in 2012 suggesting signs of microbial life on Mars.

The Viking orbiters revealed that large floods of water carved deep valleys, eroded grooves into bedrock, and traveled thousands of kilometers. Areas of branched streams, in the southern hemisphere, suggest that rain once fell. [53] [54] [55]  Mars Pathfinder [ edit ]      Sojourner takes Alpha Proton X-ray Spectrometer measurements of the Yogi Rock .    Main articles: Mars Pathfinder and Mars landing  Mars Pathfinder was a U.S. spacecraft that landed a base station with a roving probe on Mars on July 4, 1997. It consisted of a lander and a small 10.6 kilograms (23lb) wheeled robotic rover named Sojourner, which was the first rover to operate on the surface of Mars. [56] [57] In addition to scientific objectives, the Mars Pathfinder mission was also a "proof-of-concept" for various technologies, such as an airbag landing system and automated obstacle avoidance, both later exploited by the Mars Exploration Rovers . [56]  Mars Global Surveyor [ edit ]  Main article: Mars Global Surveyor     Gullies, similar to those formed on Earth, are visible on this image from Mars Global Surveyor.    After the 1992 failure of NASA's Mars Observer orbiter, NASA retooled and launched Mars Global Surveyor (MGS). Mars Global Surveyor launched on November 7, 1996, and entered orbit on September 12, 1997. After a year and a half trimming its orbit from a looping ellipse to a circular track around the planet, the spacecraft began its primary mapping mission in March 1999. It observed the planet from a low-altitude, nearly polar orbit over the course of one complete Martian year, the equivalent of nearly two Earth years. Mars Global Surveyor completed its primary mission on January 31, 2001, and completed several extended mission phases. [ citation needed ]  The mission studied the entire Martian surface, atmosphere, and interior, and returned more data about the red planet than all previous Mars missions combined. The data has been archived and remains available publicly. [58]     A color-coded elevation map produced from data collected by Mars Global Surveyor indicating the result of floods on Mars.    Among key scientific findings, Global Surveyor took pictures of gullies and debris flow features that suggest there may be current sources of liquid water, similar to an aquifer , at or near the surface of the planet. Similar channels on Earth are formed by flowing water, but on Mars the temperature is normally too cold and the atmosphere too thin to sustain liquid water. Nevertheless, many scientists hypothesize that liquid groundwater can sometimes surface on Mars, erode gullies and channels, and pool at the bottom before freezing and evaporating. [ citation needed ]  Magnetometer readings showed that the planet's magnetic field is not globally generated in the planet's core, but is localized in particular areas of the crust. New temperature data and closeup images of the Martian moon Phobos showed that its surface is composed of powdery material at least 1 metre (3feet) thick, caused by millions of years of meteoroid impacts. Data from the spacecraft's laser  altimeter gave scientists their first 3-D views of Mars' north polar ice cap. [ citation needed ] On November 5, 2006 MGS lost contact with Earth. [59] NASA ended efforts to restore communication on January 28, 2007. [60]  Mars Odyssey and Mars Express [ edit ]  Main articles: 2001 Mars Odyssey and Mars Express  In 2001, NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter arrived at Mars. Its mission is to use spectrometers and imagers to hunt for evidence of past or present water and volcanic activity on Mars. In 2002, it was announced that the probe's gamma ray spectrometer and neutron spectrometer had detected large amounts of hydrogen , indicating that there are vast deposits of water ice in the upper three meters of Mars' soil within 60 latitude of the south pole. [ citation needed ]  On June 2, 2003, the European Space Agency 's Mars Express set off from Baikonur Cosmodrome to Mars. The Mars Express craft consists of the Mars Express Orbiter and the stationary lander Beagle 2 . The lander carried a digging device and the smallest mass spectrometer created to date, as well as a range of other devices, on a robotic arm in order to accurately analyze soil beneath the dusty surface to look for biosignatures and biomolecules . [ citation needed ]  The orbiter entered Mars orbit on December 25, 2003, and Beagle 2 entered Mars' atmosphere the same day. However, attempts to contact the lander failed. Communications attempts continued throughout January, but Beagle 2 was declared lost in mid-February, and a joint inquiry was launched by the UK and ESA. The Mars Express Orbiter confirmed the presence of water ice and carbon dioxide ice at the planet's south pole, while NASA had previously confirmed their presence at the north pole of Mars. [ citation needed ]  The lander's fate remained a mystery until it was located intact on the surface of Mars in a series of images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter . [61] [62] The images suggest that two of the spacecraft's four solar panels failed to deploy, blocking the spacecraft's communications antenna. Beagle 2 is the first British and first European probe to achieve a soft landing on Mars.

[ citation needed ] The mission's scientific objective is to search for and characterize a wide range of rocks and soils that hold clues to past water activity on Mars. The mission is part of NASA's Mars Exploration Program, which includes three previous successful landers: the two Viking program landers in 1976; and Mars Pathfinder probe in 1997. [ citation needed ]  Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter [ edit ]  Main article: Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter  The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) is a multipurpose spacecraft designed to conduct reconnaissance and exploration of Mars from orbit. The $720 million USD spacecraft was built by Lockheed Martin under the supervision of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , launched August 12, 2005, and entered Mars orbit on March 10, 2006. [63]  The MRO contains a host of scientific instruments such as the HiRISE camera, CTX camera, CRISM, and SHARAD . The HiRISE camera is used to analyze Martian landforms, whereas CRISM and SHARAD can detect water , ice , and minerals on and below the surface. Additionally, MRO is paving the way for upcoming generations of spacecraft through daily monitoring of Martian weather and surface conditions, searching for future landing sites, and testing a new telecommunications system that enable it to send and receive information at an unprecedented bitrate , compared to previous Mars spacecraft. Data transfer to and from the spacecraft occurs faster than all previous interplanetary missions combined and allows it to serve as an important relay satellite for other missions.

[64]  The NASA Dawn spacecraft used the gravity of Mars in 2009 to change direction and velocity on its way to Vesta , and tested out Dawn 's cameras and other instruments on Mars. [65]  Fobos-Grunt [ edit ]  Main article: Fobos-Grunt  In November 8, 2011, Russia's Roscosmos launched an ambitious mission called Fobos-Grunt . It consisted of a lander aimed to retrieve a sample back to Earth from Mars' moon Phobos , and place the Chinese Yinghuo-1 probe in Mars' orbit. The Fobos-Grunt mission suffered a complete control and communications failure shortly after launch and was left stranded in low Earth orbit , later falling back to Earth. [66] The Yinghuo-1 satellite and Fobos-Grunt underwent destructive re-entry on January 15, 2012, finally disintegrating over the Pacific Ocean.

The NASA Mars Science Laboratory mission with its rover named Curiosity , was launched on November 26, 2011, [70] [71] and landed on Mars on August 6, 2012 on Aeolis Palus in Gale Crater . The rover carries instruments designed to look for past or present conditions relevant to the past or present habitability of Mars. [72] [73] [74] [75]  MAVEN [ edit ]  NASA's MAVEN is an orbiter mission to study the upper atmosphere of Mars. [76] It will also serve as a communications relay satellite for robotic landers and rovers on the surface of Mars. MAVEN was launched 18 November 2013 and reached Mars on 22 September 2014. [ citation needed ]  Mars Orbiter Mission [ edit ]  The Mars Orbiter Mission , also called Mangalyaan , was launched on 5 November 2013 by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). [77] It was successfully inserted into Martian orbit on 24 September 2014. The mission is a technology demonstrator, and as secondary objective, it will also study the Martian atmosphere. This is India's first mission to Mars, and with it, ISRO became the fourth space agency to successfully reach Mars after the Soviet Union, NASA (USA) and ESA (Europe). It also made ISRO the second space agency to reach Mars orbit on its first attempt (the first national one, after the international ESA), and also the first Asian country to successfully send an orbiter to Mars. It was completed in a record low budget of $71 million, [78] [79] making it the least-expensive Mars mission to date. [80]  Trace Gas Orbiter and EDM [ edit ]  Main articles: Trace Gas Orbiter and Schiaparelli EDM lander  The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter is an atmospheric research orbiter built in collaboration between ESA and Roscosmos. It was injected into Mars orbit on 19 October 2016 to gain a better understanding of methane ( CH 4 ) and other trace gases present in the Martian atmosphere that could be evidence for possible biological or geological activity. [81]  Future missions [ edit ]  See also: Mars sample return mission     Computer-design drawing for NASA's 2020 Mars Rover .     In August 2012, NASA selected InSight , a $425 million lander mission originally planned for 2016, with a drill and seismometer to determine the interior structure of Mars. [82] [83] [84] The launch was moved to May 5, 2018. Two flyby CubeSats called MarCO will be launched with InSight to provide real-time telemetry during the entry and landing of InSight . The CubeSats will separate from the Atlas V booster after launch and travel on their own trajectories to Mars. [85] [86] [87] The launch has been rescheduled from March 2016 to May 2018. [88]  As part of the ExoMars program, ESA and the Russian Federal Space Agency plan to send the ExoMars rover in 2020 to search for past or present microscopic life on Mars . [89]  The Mars 2020 rover mission by NASA will be launched in 2020, and it is based on the Mars Science Laboratory design. The scientific payload will be focused on astrobiology . [90]  The 2020 Chinese Mars Mission is planned to comprise an orbiter, a lander and a small rover.  The United Arab Emirates will send an orbiter to Mars, the Emirates Mars Mission , in 2020. [91] [92]  The ISRO plans to send a follow up mission to its Mars Orbiter Mission in the 20212022 timeframe; it is called Mangalyaan 2 . This mission will consist of a lander and possibly a rover. [93]   Proposals [ edit ]   The Finnish-Russian Mars MetNet concept would use multiple small meteorological stations on Mars to establish a widespread observation network to investigate the planet's atmospheric structure, physics and meteorology. [94] The MetNet precursor or demonstrator was considered for a piggyback launch on Fobos-Grunt , [95] and on the two proposed to fly on the 2016 and 2020 ExoMars spacecraft. [94]  The Mars-Grunt is a Russian mission concept to bring a sample of Martian soil to Earth. [96]  A ESA-NASA team produced a three-launch architecture concept for a Mars sample return, which uses a rover to cache small samples, a Mars ascent stage to send it into orbit, and an orbiter to rendezvous with it above Mars and take it to Earth. [97] Solar-electric propulsion could allow a one launch sample return instead of three. [98]  The Mars Scout Program's SCIM would involve a probe grazing the upper atmosphere of Mars to collect dust and air for return to Earth. [99]  On 10 Nov 2014, China unveiled a prototype model of a Mars rover based on its lunar rover Yutu at an annual air show at Zhuhai. The CASC also said that a mission including an orbiter, lander and the rover ( 2020 Chinese Mars Mission ) will be sent in 2020. [100]  Japan is working on a mission concept called MELOS rover that would look for biosignatures of extant life on Mars . [101]   Other future mission concepts include polar probes, Martian aircraft and a network of small meteorological stations. [97] Longterm areas of study may include Martian lava tubes, resource utilization, and electronic charge carriers in rocks. [102] [103] Micromissions are another possibility, such as piggybacking a small spacecraft on an Ariane 5 rocket and using a lunar gravity assist to get to Mars. [104]  Human mission proposals [ edit ]     Concept for NASA Design Reference Mission Architecture 5.0 (2009).    Main article: Human mission to Mars  Many people have long advocated a human mission to Mars , perhaps eventually leading to the permanent colonization of Mars , as the next logical step for a human space program after lunar exploration. Aside from the prestige such a mission would bring, advocates argue that humans would easily be able to outperform robotic explorers, justifying the expense. Aerospace engineer Bob Zubrin is one of the proponents of such missions. Some critics contend unmanned robots can perform better than humans at a fraction of the expense. If life exists on Mars, a human mission could contaminate it by introducing earthly microbes, so robotic exploration would be preferable. [105]  ESA [ edit ]  The ESA has plans to land humans on Mars between 2030 and 2035. [106] This will be preceded by successively larger probes, starting with the launch of the ExoMars probe [106] and a planned joint NASAESA Mars sample return mission . [107]  NASA [ edit ]     Artistic simulated photo looking out a portal spacecraft coming for a Mars landing.    Human exploration by the United States was identified as a long-term goal in the Vision for Space Exploration announced in 2004 by then US President George W. Bush . [108] The planned Orion spacecraft would be used to send a human expedition to Earth's moon by 2020 as a stepping stone to a Mars expedition. On September 28, 2007, NASA administrator Michael D. Griffin stated that NASA aims to put a person on Mars by 2037. [109]  On December 2, 2014, NASA's Advanced Human Exploration Systems and Operations Mission Director Jason Crusan and Deputy Associate Administrator for Programs James Reuthner announced tentative support for the Boeing "Affordable Mars Mission Design" including radiation shielding, centrifugal artificial gravity, in-transit consumable resupply, and a lander which can return. [110] [111] Reuthner suggested that if adequate funding was forthcoming, the proposed mission would be expected in the early 2030s. [112]  On October 8, 2015, NASA published its official plan for human exploration and colonization of Mars. They called it "Journey to Mars". The plan operates through three distinct phases leading up to fully sustained colonization. [113]   The first stage, already underway, is the "Earth Reliant" phase. This phase continues utilizing the International Space Station until 2024; validating deep space technologies and studying the effects of long duration space missions on the human body.  The second stage, "Proving Ground," moves away from Earth reliance and ventures into cislunar space for most of its tasks. This is when NASA plans to capture an asteroid (planned for 2020), test deep space habitation facilities, and validate capabilities required for human exploration of Mars. Finally, phase three is the transition to independence from Earth resources.  The last stage, the "Earth Independent" phase, includes long term missions on the lunar surface which leverage surface habitats that only require routine maintenance, and the harvesting of Martian resources for fuel, water, and building materials. NASA is still aiming for human missions to Mars in the 2030s, though Earth independence could take decades longer. [114]       Journey to Mars  Science, Exploration, Technology.    On August 28, 2015, NASA funded a year long simulation to study the effects of a year long Mars mission on six scientists. The scientists lived in a bio dome on a Mauna Loa mountain in Hawaii with limited connection to the outside world and were only allowed outside if they were wearing spacesuits. [115] [116]  NASAs human Mars exploration plans have evolved through the NASA Mars Design Reference Missions , a series of design studies for human exploration of Mars.  Zubrin [ edit ]  Mars Direct , a low-cost human mission proposed by Robert Zubrin , founder of the Mars Society , would use heavy-lift Saturn V class rockets, such as the Ares V , to skip orbital construction, LEO rendezvous, and lunar fuel depots. A modified proposal, called " Mars to Stay ", involves not returning the first immigrant explorers immediately, if ever (see Colonization of Mars ). [108] [109] [117] [117]  [118]  Probing difficulties [ edit ]     Deep Space 2 technology     Mars Spacecraft 19881999   Spacecraft  Outcome    Phobos 1  Failure    Phobos 2  Failure    Mars Observer  Failure    Mars 96  Failure    Mars Pathfinder  Success    Mars Global Surveyor  Success    Mars Climate Orbiter  Failure    Mars Polar Lander  Failure    Deep Space 2  Failure    Nozomi  Failure    The challenge, complexity and length of Mars missions have led to many mission failures. [119] The high failure rate of missions launched from Earth attempting to explore Mars is informally called the "Mars Curse" or "Martian Curse". [120] The phrase "Galactic Ghoul" [121] or "Great Galactic Ghoul", referring to a fictitious space monster that subsists on a diet of Mars probes , was coined in 1997 by Time Magazine journalist Donald Neff , and is sometimes facetiously used to "explain" the recurring difficulties. [122] [123] [124] [125]  Two Soviet probes were sent to Mars in 1988 as part of the Phobos program . Phobos 1 operated normally until an expected communications session on 2 September 1988 failed to occur. The problem was traced to a software error, which deactivated attitude thrusters causing the spacecrafts' solar arrays to no longer point at the Sun, depleting Phobos 1 batteries. Phobos 2 operated normally throughout its cruise and Mars orbital insertion phases on January 29, 1989, gathering data on the Sun, interplanetary medium, Mars, and Phobos. Shortly before the final phase of the mission, during which the spacecraft was to approach within 50 m of Phobos' surface and release two landers, one a mobile 'hopper', the other a stationary platform, contact with Phobos 2 was lost. The mission ended when the spacecraft signal failed to be successfully reacquired on March 27, 1989. The cause of the failure was determined to be a malfunction of the on-board computer. [ citation needed ]  Just a few years later in 1992 Mars Observer , launched by NASA, failed as it approached Mars. Mars 96 , an orbiter launched on November 16, 1996 by Russia failed, when the planned second burn of the Block D-2 fourth stage did not occur. [126]  Following the success of Global Surveyor and Pathfinder, another spate of failures occurred in 1998 and 1999, with the Japanese Nozomi orbiter and NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter , Mars Polar Lander , and Deep Space 2 penetrators all suffering various fatal errors. The Mars Climate Orbiter was noted for mixing up U.S. customary units with metric units , causing the orbiter to burn up while entering Mars' atmosphere. [127]  The European Space Agency has also attempted to land two probes on the Martian surface; Beagle 2 , a British-built lander that failed to deploy its solar arrays properly after touchdown in December 2003, and Schiaparelli , part of the ExoMars mission consisting of itself and the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter . Contact with the Schiaparelli EDM lander was lost 50 seconds before touchdown. [128] It was later confirmed that the lander struck the surface at a high velocity, possibly exploding.

For example, there were not many missions launched in the late 1970s, but this was a time where the Viking program had two orbiters and two landers active at Mars, and one lander remained active until 1982. Another consideration is size and effort of each mission.                                      1   2   3   4   5     1960   1965   1970   1975   1980   1985   1990   1995   2000   2005   2010   2015   2020        Failure   Partial success   Success   In transit   Scheduled     Timeline [ edit ]    Mission (19601969)  Launch  Arrival at Mars  Termination  Elements  Outcome  Mission budget, $ bln  Launch mass, t  Mass of orbiter / lander / rover, t     Mars 1M No.1  10 October 1960   10 October 1960  Flyby  Failure (at launch)   0.66 [131]      Mars 1M No.2  14 October 1960   14 October 1960  Flyby  Failure (at launch)   0.66 [131]      Mars 2MV-4 No.1  24 October 1962   24 October 1962  Flyby  Failure (broke up shortly after launch)   0.88 [131]      Mars 1  1 November 1962   21 March 1963  Flyby  Partial success: some data collected, but lost contact before reaching Mars, flyby at approx. 193,000km   0.89 [131]      Mars 2MV-3 No.1  4 November 1962   19 January 1963  Lander  Failure (failed to leave Earth's orbit)   0.90 [131]  0.26 [131]     Mariner 3  5 November 1964   5 November 1964  Flyby  Failure during launch ruined trajectory   0.26 [131]      Mariner 4  28 November 1964  14 July 1965  21 December 1967  Flyby  Success (21 images returned) [10]  0.08 [132]  0.26 [131]      Zond 2  30 November 1964   May 1965  Flyby (intended lander)  Failure (communication lost three months before reaching Mars)   0.98 [131]      Mariner 6  25 February 1969  31 July 1969  August 1969  Flyby  Success   0.41 [131]      Mariner 7  27 March 1969  5 August 1969  August 1969  Flyby  Success   0.41 [131]      Mars 2M No.521  27 March 1969   27 March 1969  Orbiter  Failure (at launch)   3.55 [131]  2.10 [131]     Mars 2M No.522  2 April 1969   2 April 1969  Orbiter  Failure (at launch)   3.55 [131]  2.10 [131]    Mission (19701989)  Launch  Arrival at Mars  Termination  Elements  Outcome  Mission budget  Launch mass, t  Mass of orbiter / lander / rover, t     Mariner 8  8 May 1971   8 May 1971  Orbiter  Failure (at launch)   1.00 [131]  0.60 [131]     Kosmos 419  10 May 1971   12 May 1971  Orbiter  Failure (at launch)   3.80 [131]  2.50 [131]     Mariner 9  30 May 1971  14 November 1971  27 October 1972  Orbiter  Success (first successful orbit)   1.00 [131]  0.52 [131]     Mars 2  19 May 1971  27 November 1971  22 August 1972  Orbiter  Success   4.65 [131]  2.50 [131]    27 November 1971  Lander, rover [56]  Failure.
