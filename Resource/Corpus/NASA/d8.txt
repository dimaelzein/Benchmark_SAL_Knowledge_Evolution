The program was originally intended to create a family of experimental aircraft not intended for production beyond the limited number of each design built solely for flight research. [1] The first X-Plane, the Bell X-1 , was the first rocket-powered airplane to break the sound barrier on October 14, 1947. [2] X-Planes have set numerous milestones since then, both manned and unmanned. [3]  Crewed missions [ edit ]  See also: NASA Manned programs     Shuttle launch profiles.

Two have ended in failure, causing the death of the entire crew: STS-51-L ( the Challenger disaster ) in 1986, and STS-107 ( the Columbia disaster ) in 2003. ( Apollo 1 in 1967 lost three crew members but never launched.)

The Shuttle-Mir missions were all Space Shuttle missions, and are also counted under the Space Shuttle program missions in the table.    Future [ edit ]  On May 7, 2009 the Obama Administration announced the launch of an independent review of planned U.S. human space flight activities with the goal of ensuring that the nation is on a vigorous and sustainable path to achieving its boldest aspirations in space. The review was conducted by a panel of experts led by Norman Augustine , the former CEO of Lockheed Martin , who served on the Presidents Council of Advisers on Science and Technology under both Democrat and Republican presidents.  The "Review of United States Human Space Flight Plans" was to examine ongoing and planned National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) development activities, as well as potential alternatives and present options for advancing a safe, innovative, affordable, and sustainable human space flight program in the years following Space Shuttle retirement. The panel worked closely with NASA and sought input from the United States Congress , the White House , the public, industry, and international partners as it developed its options. It presented its results on October 22, 2009. [5] [6]  In February 2010, Obama announced his proposal to cancel the Constellation Program as part of the 2011 Economic Projects. Constellation was officially cancelled by the NASA Budget Authorization Act on 11 October 2010.  NASA brought the Orion MPCV back to life from the defunct Constellation Program and successfully test launched the first capsule on December 5, 2014 aboard EFT-1 . After a near perfect flight traveling 3600 miles above Earth, the spacecraft was recovered for study. NASA plans to use the Orion crew vehicle to send humans to deep space locations such as the Moon, Near Earth Asteroids, and Mars starting in the 2020s. Orion will be powered by NASA's new heavy lift vehicle, the Space Launch System (SLS), which is currently under development. Orion's next flight, along with the first SLS flight, is slated to launch no later than November 2018, with the designation of Exploration Mission 1 . This mission will send an uncrewed Orion capsule around the Moon. It will be succeeded by Exploration Mission 2 , sending a crewed Orion spacecraft to an undetermined location in the early 2020s.
