The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history. History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations. The main site for Archive Team is at archiveteam.org and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs. This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the Wayback Machine , providing a path back to lost websites and work. Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.  The Archive Team Panic Downloads are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.      Collection: ArchiveBot: The Archive Team Crowdsourced Crawler   ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites). To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently. There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at http://www.archivebot.com . ArchiveBot's source code can be found at https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot .

Continuing on their more-than-39-year journey since their 1977 launches, they each are much farther away from Earth and the sun than Pluto. In August 2012, Voyager 1 made the historic entry into interstellar space, the region between stars, filled with material ejected by the death of nearby stars millions of years ago. Scientists hope to learn more about this region when Voyager 2, in the "heliosheath" -- the outermost layer of the heliosphere where the solar wind is slowed by the pressure of interstellar medium -- also reaches interstellar space. Both spacecraft are still sending scientific information about their surroundings through the Deep Space Network, or DSN. The primary mission was the exploration of Jupiter and Saturn. After making a string of discoveries there -- such as active volcanoes on Jupiter's moon Io and intricacies of Saturn's rings -- the mission was extended. Voyager 2 went on to explore Uranus and Neptune, and is still the only spacecraft to have visited those outer planets. The adventurers' current mission, the Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM), will explore the outermost edge of the Sun's domain. And beyond.  read more           VOYAGER 1   DISTANCE  FROM EARTH        DISTANCE  FROM THE SUN        ROUNDTRIP LIGHT  TIME FROM THE EARTH     (hh:mm:ss)   VOYAGER 2   DISTANCE  FROM EARTH        DISTANCE  FROM THE SUN        ROUNDTRIP LIGHT  TIME FROM THE EARTH     (hh:mm:ss)     FAQs    Question: Are the distance counters rolling backwards?  Answer: Often they are, and it's actually not an error.  This is caused by the fact that Earth moves around the sun more quickly than either Voyager spacecraft is departing from Earth.  So, at certain times of the year, the distance between Earth and each Voyager actually decreases.  more FAQs        COSMIC RAY DATA  VOYAGER 1      VOYAGER 2        What's this?  Scientists have three key indicators for determining whether the Voyager spacecraft have reached interstellar space. 1)"Inside Particles" A drop to about 2 particles per second of low-energy particles means that particles originate from inside the solar bubble. (Scientists consider a drop to the background rate of about 2 particles per second to mean there are no more inside particles.) 2) "Outside Particles" An increase and leveling off of high-energy particles coming in from far outside our solar system. 3) A shift in the direction of the magnetic field or measurements of the plasma environment. The gauge shows the data sent back from the Voyager spacecraft in average particles per second. If the outside particles show a sudden increase and the inside particles a sudden decrease, and these levels hold steady, the spacecraft are closing in on the edge of interstellar space. Scientists will only then have to verify the third key sign - a change in the direction of the magnetic field - before announcing that Voyager has entered interstellar space.
