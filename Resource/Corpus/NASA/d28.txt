The first corps of US astronauts included seven astronauts. They were trained for space flights as part of the first American manned space flight program - "Mercury". This group is also called: the 1st group of astronauts (Astronaut Group 1), "Mercury 7" (Mercury Seven), "The First Seven" (Original Seven) or the 1st set of US astronauts.

Mercury program
Work on America's first human spaceflight program began at the Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. The Langley Research Center hosted the first training of US astronauts, developed the Mercury spacecraft, tested the first Mercury spacecraft, and developed flight and landing control and management systems.

In 1958, the US National Space Agency, NASA, was formed. T. Keith Glennan was appointed NASA's first administrator. The task of developing the first American ship was entrusted to the Langley Research Center. Specifically, the development was carried out by engineers from the Pilotless Aircraft Research Division. On November 5, 1958, many specialists from the unmanned vehicles department were transferred to the specially created Space Department (Space Task Group, STG). In the future, it was in this department that work began on the program of manned flights. In the summer of 1959, about 400 people worked in the department. Since the summer of 1959, practical work began on the implementation of the Mercury program. One group of department specialists was sent to Florida, where the construction of launch pads was planned. At the same time, the second group of specialists went to St. Louis, where the Mercury spacecraft was being created at the McDonnell Aircraft Corp.

In September 1961, the decision was made to move the Space Department to Houston. On November 1, 1961, the Space Works Division was reorganized into the Manned Spacecraft Center. On July 1, 1962, the Manned Spacecraft Center was moved to Houston. Later, this center was transformed into the Space Center. Johnson.

On November 26, 1958, the name "Mercury", the name of one of the gods of ancient Roman mythology, was chosen for the first American manned space flight program. The god Mercury is the messenger of the gods, the patron of trade. In ancient Greek mythology, Hermes corresponded to Mercury. On December 17, 1958, NASA administrator Keith Glennan officially announced the name of the manned flight program as "Project Mercury" in Washington.

Preparing for the selection of astronauts
Preparations for the selection of the first astronauts began in November 1958. It was supposed to carry out selection in several stages. At the first stage it was supposed to select 150 candidates. Of those 150, 36 candidates were to be selected, who were to undergo medical and psychological tests. Of the 36 candidates, 12 were to be selected for nine months of training, after which it was supposed to identify 6 astronauts.

Astronaut candidates were required to have a bachelor's degree. The first astronauts could only be men between the ages of 25 and 40. Applicants were required to have three years of work experience in mathematics, physics, biology, psychology, or research experience in technical fields. Or the candidate must have had three years of experience flying in airplanes, balloons or submarines as a commander, pilot, navigator, communications specialist, engineer or equivalent position. An applicant could also become one who had completed all the requirements for a doctoral degree in the relevant scientific field or engineering and had six months of professional work experience. The applicant could be a doctor of medicine with six months of clinical or research experience. Applicants had to be prepared: for dangers comparable to those that arise in the flights of modern aircraft; to work in a difficult environment; to adequate behavior in a tense and critical situation. Such requirements could be met by: test pilots; crew members of an experimental submarine; Arctic participants European or Antarctic expeditions; participants in hostilities. The requirements could be met by people who have gone in for skydiving, mountain climbers, people involved in underwater sports, professional athletes or people who have participated in extreme experiments in conditions such as high accelerations, high or low atmospheric pressure, varying oxygen concentrations or carbon dioxide, high or low temperature. In order to avoid possible mental problems in candidates as much as possible, applicants had to have recommendations from responsible organizations. These selection requirements were reasonable and quite strict. US President Dwight Eisenhower intervened in the process of selecting candidates for participation in manned space flights. In order not to complicate the selection procedure from a wide range of applicants, Eisenhower decided during Christmas 1958 that military test pilots met all the requirements to a sufficient extent and that future astronauts should be selected from among them.

Astronauts' Choice
In January 1959, the following selection criteria were established:

age - less than 40 years
height - less than 5 feet 11 inches (1 meter 80 centimeters)
impeccable physical condition
education - bachelor's degree in engineering or equivalent education
qualification - jet pilot
special education - completed training at the school of test pilots
flight experience - at least 1500 hours
On January 5, 1959, NASA decided to select the first astronauts. The selection criteria were submitted to the US Department of Defense. The Pentagon found 110 people who met the specified criteria. The list of 110 was made up of 5 Marines, 47 Naval Aviation pilots and 58 Air Force pilots. The selection of the first astronauts from the submitted list began to be handled by a group of specialists from the Space Department of the Langley Research Center (The Langley Space Task Group): General Manager-Engineer Charles Donlan (Charles Donlan); test pilot-engineer North (North); two aviation doctors - White (White) and Ogerson (Augerson); two psychologists, Allen O. Gamble and Voas; and two psychiatrists, George E. Ruff and Edwin Z. Levy.

From a list of 110 applicants, a group of 35 people was randomly selected and invited to come to Washington on February 2, 1959 for an interview. Most of the candidates expressed their willingness and desire to participate in the Mercury program. At the same time, it was decided that only six people would be selected for the final stage of training, instead of the originally planned twelve. By the beginning of March, 36 pilots had been selected from a list of 110 for further testing. These 36 applicants were invited to the Lovelace Clinic in Albuquerque, New Mexico for more in-depth medical and psychological evaluations. 32 applicants accepted this invitation. The 32 remaining candidates received assurances that the results of examinations at the Lovelace Clinic and at the Wright Research Center would be classified. These results, if not included in the corps of astronauts, will not be available to anyone in order to exclude a possible impact on their future flight career. Of the 32 candidates examined, only one did not pass the test at the Lovelace Clinic. The 31 remaining candidates were sent for further testing at the Wright Air Development Center in Dayton, Ohio. After examinations at the Wright Research Center, by the end of March, 18 candidates remained. The choice of 6 astronauts from the remaining 18 candidates was done by Donlan, White and North. It was incredibly difficult to choose six. It was decided to include seven astronauts in the first group. The last 24 candidates who were eliminated were left with the hope of participating in subsequent space programs.

By April 2, 1959, seven candidates had been selected for upcoming manned space flights. Officially, the names of the seven selected pilots were announced on April 9, 1959. These pilots were called astronauts. This name was chosen by analogy with aeronauts (aeronauts or people who flew in balloons) and argonauts (navigators - the ancient Greeks who were looking for the "Golden Fleece" in unknown lands). All selected pilots were mature family men of discreet appearance, all had an engineering background, all were in excellent physical and psychological health, and were professional pilots of modern aircraft.


First Seven (left to right): Gordon Cooper, Walter Schirra, Alan Shepard, Virgil Grissom, John Glenn, Donald Slayton, Scott Carpenter
The first seven were:

Gordon Cooper (L. Gordon Cooper Jr.) - Air Force Captain
Virgil I. "Gus" Grissom - Air Force Captain
Donald K. "Deke" Slayton - Air Force Captain
Scott Carpenter - Lieutenant naval aviation
Alan B. Shepard Jr. - First Lieutenant, Naval Aviation
Walter M. Schirra Jr. - Senior Lieutenant, Naval Aviation
John H. Glenn Jr. - Lieutenant Colonel, Naval Aviation
The oldest in age (37 years) and in rank was John Glenn. The youngest was Gordon Cooper - 32 years old.

On April 27, 1959, selected astronauts began training at the Langley Research Center. The training included a bit of everything: from theoretical classes in astronomy, celestial mechanics and navigation to exercises on simulators and scuba diving to simulate a state of weightlessness. Each astronaut specialized in a particular technical discipline. Cooper and Slayton took a closer look at launch vehicles and launch equipment. Carpenter specialized in communications and navigation systems. Glenn - in the ship's cockpit equipment. Grissom - in flight control systems. Schirra - in life support systems and spacesuits. Shepard - in tracking and rescue systems. Training at the Langley Research Center continued until the move to Houston, Texas.

space flights
On February 21, 1961, it was decided that Alan Shepard, Virgil Grissom and John Glenn would take part in the first three manned flights.

On May 5, 1961, Alan Shepard made the first suborbital manned space flight. This flight was called the Mercury-Redstone-3 mission.
On July 21, 1961, Virgil Grissom also made a suborbital flight - the Mercury-Redstone-4 mission.
On November 29, 1961, John Glenn was assigned to perform the first orbital flight under the Mercury program.
On February 20, 1962, John Glenn made his flight - the Mercury-Atlas-6 mission.
On May 24, 1962, Scott Carpenter made his flight - the Mercury-Atlas-7 mission.
On September 18, 1962, Donald Slayton was suspended from training for space flights for medical reasons (due to heart problems that were discovered in him back in 1959). He nevertheless flew into space, but much later (1975) on the last ship of the Apollo series as part of the ASTP program, also known as the Soyuz-Apollo.
On October 3, 1962, Walter Schirra made his flight - the Mercury-Atlas-8 mission.
May 15 - 16, 1963 - the longest and last flight under the Mercury program - the Mercury-Atlas-9 mission - was made by Gordon Cooper.
On June 12, 1963, the cancellation of the planned Mercury-Atlas-10 flight was announced. On October 3-4, 1963, the final conference on the Mercury program was held in Houston. The first American manned flight program was completed.
