Bees make honey to feed their young and so they have something to eat during the winter.  Killer bees have been known to chase people for over a 1/4 mile once they get excited and aggressive.  Certain species of bees die after stinging because their stingers, which are attached to their abdomen, have little barbs or hooks on them. When this type of bee tries to fly away after stinging something, part of the abdomen is ripped away.     There are about 20,000 different species of bees in the world. Bees live in colonies that contain the queen bee, the worker bee and the drone. The worker bee and the queen bee are both female, but only the queen bee can reproduce. All drones are male. Worker bees clean the hive, collecting pollen and nectar to feed the colony and they take care of the offspring. The drones only job is to mate with the queen. The queens only job is to lay eggs.  Bees store their venom in a sac attached to their stinger and only female bees sting. That is because the stinger, called an ovipositor , is part of the female bees reproductive design. A queen bee uses her ovipositor to lay eggs as well as sting. Sterile females, also called worker bees, dont lay eggs. They just use their ovipositors to sting.  Bees see all colors except the color red. That and their sense of smell help them find the flowers they need to collect pollen. Not only is pollen a food source for bees, but also some of the pollen is dropped in flight, resulting incross pollination. The relationship between the plant and the insect is calledsymbiosis.

They are very social bees and live in large "families". Unlike honeybees, bumblebees can sting more than once because their stingers are smooth and do not get caught in the skin when they fly away.    Size: 1"  Shape: Oval, bee shaped  Color: Black with yellow stripes  Legs: 6  Wings: Yes  Antenna: Yes    Common Name: Bumble bee  Kingdom: Animalia  Phylum: Arthropoda  Class: Insecta  Order: Hymenoptera  Family: Apidae  Species: Bombus       Diet:  Worker bees gather both pollen and nectar from flowers to feed to the larvae and other members of the colony.    Habitat:  Bumblebees often nest in the ground, but can be found above ground around patio areas or decks. They will sometimes build their nests in attics or under roof beams. If disturbed, bumblebees will buzz in a loud volume, and they will aggressively defend their nests.    Impact:  As part of the aggressive defense of their nests, bumblebees will chase nest invaders for long distances. The bumblebee sting is one of the most painful stings. Swelling and irritation can last for days after you are actually stung.    Prevention:     Bumblebees can be prevented through inspection of potential nesting areas and removal of potential nesting materials.  Because bumblebees will sting when threatened, homeowners are advised not to address the infestation themselves. A pest management professional or beekeeper should be called in to help.
