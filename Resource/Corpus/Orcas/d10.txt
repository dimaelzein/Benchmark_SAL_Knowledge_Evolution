Location:  North Beach Inn on Orcas Island is located just a couple of miles from the village of Eastsound (the islands main commercial center) where you will find a relatively large, well-stocked grocery store, a number of restaurants, coffee shops, and unique artisan shops. There is alsoa liquor store, a movie theater, and an internet caf. Being near Eastsound, WA means we are less than half-an-hours drive west to the ferry landing or east to Moran State Park.  The ever-changing ocean  Turning down our road you will venture through over half a mile of woods and fields before even reaching the cottages and beach. So although centrally located and close to most of the San Juan Islands many amenities, we are able to maintain a sense of isolation.
